# How Do We Talk About Terrorism?
by Chris Franzini

## Summary
This is my fourth project for the [Metis](http://thisismetis.com) NYC Spring 2017 Data Science Bootcamp. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning to examine the language used to describe terrorism. Specifically, it attempts to illustrate some of the claims made by [Critical Terrorism Studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_terrorism_studies), particularly that terrorism as it is most-commonly used is a socially-constructed label applied selectively to certain acts of political violence largely depending on the actors involved, including both the perpetrators and the victims. Labeling an act as terrorism also suggests the act is exceptional from other acts of political violence. Such connotations and selective labeling teach people to associate particular people with terrorism and consider them to be exceptionally dangerous. This generalization has real ramifications for people who fit the associated profiles--take the recent travel ban, for example.

This project uses NLP and topic modeling to analyze 25 years of [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) articles covering terrorism to see if such associations are present.
